CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Read the ENTIRE project description carefully and ANALYZE all features mentioned
- Group related features into DISTINCT major feature areas (Epics)
- You should generate between 3 and 10 Epics depending on the project scope — DO NOT always generate the same number
- Each Epic must represent a DIFFERENT major system capability
- Each Epic should have between 1 and 5 User Stories depending on the complexity of that feature area:
  - Simple features (e.g., a settings page, a logout button): 1 story
  - Medium features (e.g., user profile, notifications): 2-3 stories
  - Complex features (e.g., real-time dashboard, payment processing, AI recommendations): 4-5 stories
- The total number of stories should be PROPORTIONAL to the project's complexity — a simple app might have 8-12 stories total, while a complex platform could have 20-35
- DO NOT always generate the same count of epics or stories — VARY them based on the actual description
- Generate SPECIFIC, DETAILED content based on the ACTUAL requirements provided
- DO NOT use generic placeholders or vague descriptions
- Every Epic, User Story, and Test Case must be directly relevant to the project description
- Include MEASURABLE METRICS in all acceptance criteria and expected results (e.g., "within 2 seconds", "at least 99.5%", "every 500 milliseconds", "within 3 meters")

ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Identify the major feature categories from the project description — group small related features together rather than creating one epic per bullet point
2. Each Epic should cover a distinct functional area (e.g., Authentication, Dashboard, Data Entry, Analytics, etc.)
3. Number Epics sequentially: E1, E2, E3, E4, E5...
4. User Stories should be numbered per Epic: E1-US1, E1-US2, E2-US1, E2-US2, etc.
5. Test Cases should follow User Story IDs: E1-US1-TC1, E1-US2-TC1, E2-US1-TC1, etc.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
{description}

Analyze the description above and generate an APPROPRIATE number of Epics (between 3 and 10) with a VARYING number of User Stories per Epic (1-5 based on complexity).
Each User Story must have exactly 1 Test Case.
Output must follow this EXACT format (plain text, not markdown):

Epic E[number]: [Specific Title Based on Project Description]
Description: As a [specific stakeholder role], I want [specific high-level capability from project] so that [actual business value from requirements]

User Story E[epic#]-US[story#]: [Specific Feature Title]
Description: As a [specific user role], I want [exact feature from project description] so that [actual user benefit]
Story Points: [1-13 based on complexity]
Acceptance Criteria: Given [specific precondition with measurable context, e.g., "the user has an active session and GPS accuracy is within 2 meters"], When [specific user action from requirements], Then [specific expected outcome with measurable metrics, e.g., "the system updates the display within 200 milliseconds and logs the event with timestamp accuracy of 1 second"]

Test Case ID: E[epic#]-US[story#]-TC1
Test Case Description: Verify that [specific functionality from project description] works as specified
Input:
  - Preconditions: [Specific system state and requirements that must be met before testing, e.g., "System is powered on, user is authenticated, database connection is active"]
  - Test Data: [Concrete data examples relevant to the feature, e.g., "Username: testuser@example.com, Workout: Running, Duration: 30 min, Distance: 5km"]
  - User Action: [Specific step-by-step action the tester performs, e.g., "Navigate to workout log, select 'Running', enter duration and distance, tap 'Save'"]
Expected Result:
1. [Specific outcome with measurable metric - e.g., "Workout entry is saved to database within 2 seconds with all fields populated"]
2. [Specific validation - e.g., "Calorie calculation displays 320 kcal based on activity type, duration, and user weight"]
3. [Specific UI behavior - e.g., "Success toast notification appears for 3 seconds with message 'Workout logged successfully'"]
4. [Specific data persistence - e.g., "Workout history page shows the new entry with correct date, duration (30 min), and distance (5km)"]

EXAMPLE OF GOOD (SPECIFIC) vs BAD (GENERIC):
BAD: "Given a user is on the page, When they click submit, Then it works"
GOOD: "Given the user has entered valid GPS coordinates with accuracy within 2 meters and battery level is above 10%, When the user taps 'Start Tracking', Then the system begins recording position data every 500 milliseconds and displays real-time speed within 200ms latency"

BAD: "Preconditions: System is ready"
GOOD: "Preconditions: Vehicle control system is powered on with firmware v2.1+, GPS module has acquired satellite lock (minimum 4 satellites), obstacle detection sensors are calibrated within the last 24 hours"
